# The Meetings
A game about two human rights defenders trying to find each other in the face of repressive government forces.

Made at the Amnesty Game Jam at the CRI in Paris, France.

The central team was Damien Chouchen, Alexis Moroz, and Jesse Himmelstein, with excellent contributions by Aur√©lien Montero for sound design and Lorelei Simon for graphic design. 

Thanks for the Amnesty team for their wonderful guidance and feedback.

## Development
